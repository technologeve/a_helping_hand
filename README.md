# A Helping Hand

This project aims to support children recovering from hand and wrist injuries by making the physiotherapy process fun and engaging. It minimises the need for frequent in-person appointments, reducing cost and effort for families, without compromising on impact.

Recognising hand gestures, the program becomes an interactive game where the user can gain points and build confidence - it can even provide a fun minigame for siblings and parents!

This solution promotes creative escapism and confidence growth. Physiotherapy becomes exciting and accessible for a range of young patients.
